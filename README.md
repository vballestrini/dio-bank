## Overview

The Dio Banking System is a command-line application designed to simulate basic banking operations using TypeScript classes and object-oriented programming concepts. The application consists of several account types, each with distinct functionalities, and aims to demonstrate basic proficiency in TypeScript development.

### Key Features and Functionalities

- DioAccount: This account type includes deposit and withdraw methods. Deposits increase the balance, while withdrawals are only allowed for active accounts with sufficient balance.

- CompanyAccount: This account type introduces a getLoan method. Active accounts can request loans, which increase their balance based on the loan amount.

- InvestmentAccount: This account type includes a modified deposit method that adds 10 units to the deposited amount.

- Encapsulation and Privacy: All attributes within the account classes are encapsulated and private, adhering to best practices in object-oriented programming. The name and accountNumber attributes are also secured against unauthorized modification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Ensure that you have Node.js LTS and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You'll need these to manage dependencies and run the TypeScript code.

- TypeScript: Install TypeScript globally on your system. You can do this using the command:

  ```bash
    npm install -g typescript.
   ```

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
